#Game plan for this
#Need to go into gmail, grab pictures and divide into groups of 4
#Maybe learn some front end, or create some possible draft witht he picture, to create title, 
#much easier to just save all pics into file, then just recall what draft it is I suppose for when I get the other projects going
#Or just figure out how to grab images from post, then save as png, then go on from there.  The same way I will have to do with the whatnot filter I have at the moment.  
#Grabbing old post is easy
#then from the title, parse and identify the size, brand, price, etc
#Still need to figure out the whole depop issue with the sizing experiencing #REF!
#still need to test my code with a whole new database of clothing and see if parsing still works correctly
#My posting layout:::
#   Title, Size, Price, Any flaws, General description.
#save pics as jpeg or png file,
#overall, just need to create the drafts in the list, then from there can just automate through all the pics, posting 4 for each.  


#how many options in terms of this project?
#transferring post
###scrape pictures from post, and since most likely will be different amount of pics, must find someone way to keep track of that number
###then scrape the title too
###everything must stay in order. 
#creating post
#
# Grab pics from folders
# divide into groups of 4
# create a csv with 2 columns and display the first pic of the 4
# create title with same baisic layout in the 2nd
# title, era, size, price, condition, color, tags, general description
# then from there can create the depop layout, instead of scraping info from whatnot, that might help
